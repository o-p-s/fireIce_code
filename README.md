## Features

One type of card (for example a card displaying a book) looks different from another type of card(for example a card displaying a house). The view difference is simply a change of background color according to the category. 
  
  2) View 2 - On clicking the card, a view containing the detail of that book/character/house opens containing all the information about it in
details.
